IMOS Ocean Observer
===================================

IMOS Ocean Observer is a platform leveraging and integrating many IMOS data streams to increase visibility and ease of access to existing data. It will provide ‘data-fusion’ across the IMOS data, that is, to integrate and visualise data across IMOS nodes and facilities. Managers, scientists and students often struggle with data wrangling, visualisation and analysis, especially of unfamiliar or complex datasets. Many of these challenges are common across different datasets. By providing a simple platform to display and explore data – and provide the underlying code for those who wish to go further – the IMOS Ocean Observer will ensure consistency and reproducible results from IMOS data

IMOS Data can be found via:
   [AODN Portal](https://portal.aodn.org.au/)
